\description{
Input and output N values are logged.
The `X` matrix should have rows associated with a given time point and
columns associated with a given location.
The `vcv_cube` cube should have rows and columns associated with a given species,
and slices associated with a given location.
All other input matrices should have rows associated with a given species and
columns associated with a given location.
`obs_sigma` contains the standard deviations of observation error for each species.
The output array will have rows associated with a given time point,
columns associated with a given species, and 
slices associated with a given location.
