\title{Mixed-effects, autoregressive model.}
\usage{
liz_fit(formula, time_form, ar_form, data = parent.frame(1L),
  ar_bound = FALSE, rstan_control = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A required, two-sided, linear formula specifying both fixed
and random effects of the model.
The structure is similar to that in the \code{lme4} package, but more restrictive.
Random effects should be contained inside parentheses, and a bar (\code{|})
should separate the name of the fixed effect from the grouping variables.
All grouping variables must be factors without any missing levels.
Example: \code{y ~ x1 + (x2 | g1 + g2) + (x3 | g1 + g3)}.
\emph{Note:} If you do not explicitly specify a random effect for the intercept,
\code{liz_fit} will not include one. This differs from \code{lmer}.
In the above example, the intercept will not have a random effect.}

\item{time_form}{A required, one-sided formula specifying the structure of
the time series (e.g., \code{~ time | species + site + rep}).
On the left side of the bar there should be the object indicating the actual
time point (e.g., day, hour), and on the right side there should be the
variables that, together, separate all time series.
No time series should ever span multiples of these variables.}

\item{ar_form}{A required, one-sided formula specifying the grouping to use for
the autoregressive parameter(s).
All groups present here should also be present in the grouping part of the
\code{time_form} argument; an error is thrown otherwise.
If you want to use a grouping variable here that a variable in \code{time_form}
is nested within (e.g., using genus here and species in \code{time_form}),
just insert the higher-level variable (genus in the example) in \code{time_form},
as it won't effect the results.
Providing \code{NULL} for this argument causes \code{liz_fit} to use a model that does
not account for temporal autocorrelation. This can be useful for testing.}

\item{data}{An optional list, data frame, or environment that contains
the dependent, independent, and grouping variables.
By default, it uses the environment the function was executed in.}

\item{ar_bound}{An optional logical for whether to bound the autoregressive
parameter(s) <= 1. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{rstan_control}{A list of arguments passed to \code{rstan::sampling}
(e.g., \code{iter}, \code{chains}, \code{cores}). See \code{\link[rstan]{sampling}}.}
}
\value{
A list containing, among other things, a \code{stanfit} object with the model fit.
